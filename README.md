### Creation context

Created during my second semester in [Game Engine Programming](https://www.isart.ca/programmes/programmes-courts/programmeur-moteur-jeu-video/) at [Isart Digital](https://www.isart.ca/).

### My goal

My goal for this project was to create a C++ library of mathematical functions useful for video games development, used in the various projects I carried out during my studies at [Isart Digital](https://www.isart.ca/).

### Project's description

The library contains mathematical classes and functions useful for game development, such as Vectors, Matrices, Quaternions, Angles (degrees and radians), Arithmetic and Trigonometry, as well as a suite of unit tests to ensure that the library runs smoothly and avoid regressions when new features are added.

### What I learned

Creating a library of mathematical functions in C++, designed for use in projects where performance and efficiency are major concerns, enabled me to reinforce my knowledge of C++ and mathematics, while also consolidating my planning and organization skills. Furthermore, this exercise also enabled me to improve my ability to structure and develop a library that is complete and easy to use, yet easy to maintain and extend. Finally, I learned how to use Docker and Github actions to automate testing on windows and linux with MSVC and g++ respectively on push and pull requests.
### Project's progression :

The library is, although constantly being improved, usable, and used in the majority of the [projects](/en/projects) realized for my classes in [Game Engine Programming](https://www.isart.ca/programmes/programmes-courts/programmeur-moteur-jeu-video/) at [Isart Digital](https://www.isart.ca/), as well as for my game engine [Pantheon](/en/projects/pantheon).
